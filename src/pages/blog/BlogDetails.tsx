              Dr. Nguyen Nhu Dien - Medical Manager of Region 5, Northern Region, <b>VAXBOT Vaccination System</b> said:
              “Every year, about 400 million people are infected with dengue fever, but about 80% of people have no
              symptoms. Symptoms usually appear 4-10 days after being bitten by a mosquito and last from 3-7 days. About
              1 in 20 people with dengue fever can develop severe dengue fever after the initial symptoms disappear,
              usually occurring within 24-48 hours after the fever subsides (1). Therefore, after the symptoms of dengue
              fever disappear, patients should still be careful and monitor their health regularly.”

            After the dengue fever has subsided, the patient can bathe, but it is necessary to pay attention to some
            important factors to avoid adverse effects on health. When bathing, the patient should choose warm water,
            avoid bathing in water that is too hot or too cold, because sudden changes in temperature can cause stress
            to the body. At the same time, the patient should bathe gently and should not bathe for too long to avoid
            fatigue and cold body during the recovery period. If not bathing, the patient can wipe the body with a clean
            towel and warm water.

            The notion of “not bathing” when having dengue fever or after recovering from the disease often stems from
            concerns about the body being cold or having a negative impact on blood vessels. However, from a medical
            perspective, completely abstaining from bathing for a long time is unnecessary and can be counterproductive.
            Dirt and sweat accumulated on the body can become a favorable environment for bacteria, increasing the risk
            of skin infections and causing discomfort and inconvenience in daily life.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            It is important that each patient has a different health condition and bathing should be adjusted according
            to recovery ability and medical advice.

          After overcoming the dangerous stage of dengue fever for 1-2 days (after the 7th day of the disease), the
          patient will enter the recovery stage and can bathe normally. At this time, the patient will no longer have a
          fever, blood pressure will stabilize and appetite will gradually return. The white blood cell, red blood cell
          and platelet indices will all recover, proving that the body is gradually recovering.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          This is the time when the patient can bathe normally, but the immune system and blood circulation are not yet
          completely stable, because the Dengue virus causes direct damage to the blood vessels and immune system, the
          patient still needs to pay attention to bathing carefully during this period to avoid affecting the health
          that is gradually recovering.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Patients should use warm water instead of cold water or water that is too hot, and should bathe in a closed
          room to avoid catching a cold. It is important to limit bathing for too long and to bathe quickly to avoid
          negative effects on health during the recovery process.

        <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl '>Notes when bathing after dengue fever</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In addition to the questions "Can I bathe after dengue fever?" and "How long after dengue fever can I bathe?",
          many people are also interested in the notes when bathing after recovering from the disease. Experts say that
          when bathing after dengue fever, patients need to pay attention to some important factors to protect their
          health, including choosing the right time to bathe, controlling the water temperature and bathing time so that
          the body does not get tired or get cold. Specifically:{' '}
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl '>1. Bath time</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          MAlthough bathing can be done during the recovery period, the time of bathing greatly affects the patient's
          body. The best time to bathe is after the fever has subsided and the patient's health is relatively stable,
          which is about 1-2 days after the dangerous period. Bathing too soon, especially when the body temperature has
          not returned to normal, can make the patient susceptible to cold or exhaustion, slowing the recovery process
          and increasing the risk of complications.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          {' '}
          Patients should also pay attention to bathing at a time when the environmental temperature is stable, avoiding
          early morning or late evening - times when the temperature is often low. Late morning or early afternoon when
          the weather is warm is the ideal time to bathe without putting pressure on the body. At the same time, you
          should not bathe immediately after eating or when you feel too tired, as this can cause dizziness and
          hypoglycemia.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl '>2. Water temperature</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          When bathing after recovering from dengue fever, choosing the right water temperature is important to ensure
          the safety of the body. Water that is too hot can cause sudden dilation of blood vessels, increasing blood
          pressure, while cold water can cause constriction of blood vessels, affecting blood circulation.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          {' '}
          To avoid negative effects, patients should use moderately warm water. The ideal water temperature should range
          from 37 - 40 degrees Celsius, enough to keep the body warm but not damage the skin and blood vessels. Warm
          water helps to clean the body, reduce stress and increase blood circulation, thereby supporting the recovery
          process more effectively.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl '>3. Bath time</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          When bathing after dengue fever, patients need to pay attention to the bathing time to avoid damaging the
          skin. Bathing for too long can cause the skin to dry out, removing the natural oil layer that protects the
          skin from external factors. Instead of bathing for too long, patients should bathe quickly and gently,
          especially for areas of skin that are recovering or damaged.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The ideal bathing time should be limited to 5-10 minutes to ensure safety and not put pressure on the body. A
          quick bath not only helps clean the body but also reduces the risk of catching a cold or becoming exhausted.
          During the bath, the patient should also avoid rubbing the skin vigorously, especially in areas with signs of
          rash or previously damaged blood vessels, to avoid causing skin damage or pain.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          In addition to the main notes on the time, water temperature and bathing time, patients should combine other
          care measures when bathing to speed up the recovery process. You can use a soft towel to gently wipe your body
          if you feel not strong enough to take a standing bath. At the same time, after bathing, you should dry your
          body and keep your body warm, especially in cold weather or when the ambient temperature is low, to avoid
          sudden hypothermia.

        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          After recovering from dengue fever, to ensure that the disease has completely recovered and there are no
          dangerous complications, the patient needs to pay attention to health care as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className='ml-16 '>
          <p>
            - Rest properly, avoid overexertion: The body needs time to recover from illness. Therefore, patients should
            rest well, sleep 7-8 hours each night so that the body can produce growth hormone and strengthen the immune
            system. At the same time, do not do heavy work or exercise too hard in the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            - Build a scientific diet: Supplement adequate nutrients, prioritize foods rich in protein (meat, fish,
            eggs, beans, etc.), vitamins (fruits, green vegetables) and minerals (nuts). Drink enough water every day to
            help eliminate toxins and maintain electrolyte balance in the body. Limit greasy, spicy foods and carbonated
            drinks, as these foods can cause indigestion and affect the recovery process.
          </p>
          <p> </p> - Exercise gently and regularly: Start with simple exercises such as walking, yoga, etc. to help
          increase blood circulation and improve cardiovascular health. When the body is healthier, you can increase the
          intensity of exercise.
          <p>
            - Regular health monitoring: Check body temperature daily to detect early signs of fever. Observe other
            symptoms such as headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, bleeding, etc. If there are unusual signs, take the
            patient to the nearest medical center for timely examination and treatment by a doctor.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            - Prevention of reinfection: After contracting the disease, the patient is still at risk of reinfection with
            other types of dengue virus. Therefore, after 6 months of contracting dengue fever, the patient needs to be
            fully vaccinated against dengue fever. Get fully vaccinated against dengue fever as recommended by your
            doctor to strengthen immunity, prevent the risk of reinfection with other types of dengue virus.
          </p>
        </ul>

          {' '}
          <b>The Qdenga vaccine </b> (made in Germany) is capable of protecting against all 4 serotypes of the dengue
          virus, including DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4, and is indicated for people aged 4 years and older. The
          vaccine is effective in protecting against more than 80% of the risk of disease caused by 4 types of dengue
          virus and is effective in protecting against more than 90% of the risk of hospitalization, severe illness and
